Turning and turning in the widening gyre
Over the rustling sheaves

The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Leather hood providing illusionary freedom

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
The rest of the world rejoices

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
