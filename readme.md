Turning and turning in the widening gyre  
Over the rustling sheaves

The falcon cannot hear the falconer  
Leather hood providing illusionary freedom

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  
Blooms peek around the edges

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
Rejoice as the day may dawn

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
Earth welcomes her nutrients;

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
To be reborn upon the spring

Thus iron proves the worth
Once rust, now green, comes forth from the dirt
