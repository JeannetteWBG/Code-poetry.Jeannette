Second coming, come again
=========================
(by Yeats and etc..)

Turning and turning in the widening gyre  
Over the rustling sheaves

The falcon cannot hear the falconer  
Hood provides illusionary freedom

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  
Blooms and vines nibble around the edges

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  
Rejoice as the day may dawn

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  
Thirsty Earth welcomes her new nutrients;

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  
Sinks below awaiting the years turning

Thus iron proves the worth  
Once rust, now green, reborn from the dirt
